# Logistics and Warehouse Automation System 

## Project Overview

This project, developed as part of my graduation requirements, was designed to modernize and optimize the logistics and warehouse industry through automation and advanced technologies. It earned an **Excellent** grade.

### Technologies Used:
- **Software Tools**: OpenCV, PostgreSQL, Postman
- **Development Languages & Frameworks**: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Django
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4, Mecanum Wheels, 6 DoF Robotic Arm

### Key Features:

1. **Product Selection**: Users select products and specify shelf locations for retrieval or placement.
2. **Autonomous Navigation**: The robot, equipped with a line follower and star AI algorithm, moves through the warehouse to reach the destination.
3. **Object Recognition**: The robotâ€™s arm rotates and scans the environment using OpenCV to determine product coordinates.
4. **Gripper Centering**: The robot adjusts its gripper based on the coordinates for precise product handling.
5. **Product Delivery**: The robot autonomously moves to the delivery point.
6. **Product Release**: The robot gently releases the product at the desired location.

### Hardware Overview:

- **Mecanum Wheels**: Enabled omnidirectional movement, enhancing mobility in tight warehouse spaces.
- **6 DoF Robotic Arm**: Provided flexibility for complex product handling.
- **Control Unit**: The Raspberry Pi 4 served as the system's control hub, executing navigation and object recognition algorithms.
- **Navigation System**: Implemented PID control with a line follower for accurate movement, enhanced by a star AI algorithm for efficient route optimization.
